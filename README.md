# Selfhosted-Docker-Compose
These are docker compose files for self-hosted systems I've either used in the past or currently have in use. Probably most of them will be about getting a usable GenAI/ML stack with agentic MCP through Cosmos Cloud, but you'll find more.

As I get the containers functional, I'll also try to export the Cosmos-Compose to share here as well, in case that helps anyone
